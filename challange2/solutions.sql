--Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!

UPDATE customer_orders SET exclusions = NULL WHERE exclusions IN ('null', '');
UPDATE customer_orders SET extras = NULL WHERE extras IN ('null', '');
UPDATE runner_orders SET cancellation = NULL WHERE cancellation IN ('null', '');


UPDATE runner_orders
SET duration = CAST(TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE(duration, '[[:alpha:]]', '', 'g')) AS INTEGER)
WHERE duration IS NOT NULL 
  AND TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE(duration, '[[:alpha:]]', '', 'g')) <> '';

UPDATE runner_orders
SET distance = CAST(TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE(distance, '[[:alpha:]]', '', 'g')) AS DOUBLE PRECISION)
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL 
  AND TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE(distance, '[[:alpha:]]', '', 'g')) <> '';


--- You need to replace those literal 'null' strings with proper SQL NULL values before you cast the column.

UPDATE runner_orders
SET distance = NULL
WHERE LOWER(distance) = 'null';

 UPDATE runner_orders
SET duration = NULL
WHERE LOWER(duration) = 'null';



--f you want to make these changes permanent and prevent mixed data types, consider changing the columnsâ€™ types afterward:

ALTER TABLE runner_orders
ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE INTEGER USING duration::INTEGER;

ALTER TABLE runner_orders
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE DOUBLE PRECISION USING distance::DOUBLE PRECISION;
